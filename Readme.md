### Questions

#### 1. Describe possible performance optimizations for your Code.
- I am using 3 retries. If the endpoint is slow or for split second not reachable the user has to wait
- Frontend performance can be increased with a proper framework
#### 2. Which things could be done better, than youâ€™ve done it?
- I am not validating the data in the backend. When you place a direct CURL request there could be a failure.
- I can definetly improve the frontend. Using a frontend framework and splitting up the application would be more professional.
- I could have implemented a better exception handling solution. Currently throwing a custom exception.
